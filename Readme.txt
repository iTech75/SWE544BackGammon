SWE544 Backgammon Game is proposed for the SWE 544 class project in fall 2014 midterm. 

The purpose of the game is to provide a client server environment to support playing 
backgammon games over network.To keep implementation simple client functionalities 
and UI can be primitive. Addition of a GUI for the client will be bonus to the project. 

On the other hand, server component will be the heart of the project containing 
almost all the functionality in itself. Below is the system functional and non-functional 
requirements. The protocol will be discussed in a separate document.
